# Book Listing App
Project 7 of 10 in the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree

This is the point in the course where the projects started becoming much more interesting, and started pulling information from outside sources to be displayed as needed. This project was to create a book search that would iniate a search through the Google Books API from a single phrase. The Google Books API would return a JSON response that would be parsed through to find the relevant information (Book name, Author, Publish Date) and place it into a scrolling list via an ArrayAdapter. 

This course was a demonstration in Threads and Parallelism, where the data request to the Books API was done on a background thread, leaving the UI thread to remain free of obstructions.
